# APB for Virtual Machines
** This APB is deprecated.  Please use [import-vm-apb](https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/import-vm-apb). ** 

Contains [Ansible Playbook Bundle](https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle) for managing virtual machines in Kubernetes based on [Kubevirt](https://github.com/kubevirt) project.

This APB is used for creating a **generic virtual machine** from provied YAML definition.

It will probably become base for a generator for custom-VMs APBs in the near future.

There already exist specific APBs per operating system:
- [rhel-apb](https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/rhel-apb)
- [windows-apb](https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/windows-apb)
